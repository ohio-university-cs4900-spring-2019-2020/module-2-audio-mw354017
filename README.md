In this module, I added both 2D and 3D audio to the game. 
2D audio is present in the sound of the xwing's engines that the camera is from the perspective of. 
2D audio is also implemented in the sound of a laser which plays evertime the user presses 'q'.
3D audio is implemented with the sound of Darth Vader's Imperial Death March which plays louder when you're close to part of the star destroyer.
